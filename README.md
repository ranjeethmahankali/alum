# Alum: A Halfedge based Polygon Mesh Library

![Standford Bunny](assets/bunny.png)

This library is inspired by
[OpenMesh](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/software/openmesh/), hence has an
API very similar to that of OpenMesh. I love using OpenMesh in C++, and wrote
this library because I couldn't find an equivalent in Rust.
